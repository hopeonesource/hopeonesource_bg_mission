## HopeOneSource

## Mission
HopeOneSource's (HOS) mission is to connect people experiencing homelessness to nearby available services they need through a multilingual geolocated text messaging platform accessible on any computer or mobile device.

## Impact
Since HopeOneSource launched in fall 2015, the Washington DC community has used this technology to support the local efforts to prevent and end homelessness by increasing access to available housing, career, and social services -- one text message at a time. For the seond year in a row, the DC community's homeless poulation has dropped, a 7.6% reduction from January 2017 and a 17.3 percent reduction from January 2016, both according to local government data. Hypothermia deaths have been reduced by nearly 80% as well during this period.

- HopeOneSource is a volunteer led effort that has been recognized by the White House, IEEE, and Cisco.

- Nearly 1.4K are currently registered, receiving realtime notification to access nearby housing, career and social services.

- Upon completion of our open source Drupal 8 Transition, HopeOneSource will be scaling beyond DC.
